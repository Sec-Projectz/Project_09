# Introdution 
The system we are proposing is a security system to detect frauds in clothings stores. Every item of the store will have a sensor on it so if a customer takes the item from a rack the system will detect it. Only after the payment the sensor will be removed by the cashier so the system can track the items location until the payment is done. Also the system will notify the number of empty items in the racks so the employees can restock the empty items.
